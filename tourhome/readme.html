<p>The website still falls a bit short on device friendliness, therefore, it is best if the website is viewed on a 1280 x 800 resolution screen. For this sprint, our group decided that because the nature of our website revolved around massive amounts of data, that we begin implementing more back-end code to the website. This would have laid a better foundation for the user interface. Hence, during sprint one we successfully implemented a workable database. With that database we were able to give it workable functionalities -- create an account, login to an account, delete an account, and change password. Because of the implementation of server-side related code, we fell short in the user interface of the code. </p>
	
<p>The website is fairly straight forward to navigate at the moment. You can create an account using the sign-in button on the first carousel and afterwards login using that information.</p>
	
<p> For sprint two, we have decided to further the user interface to give the website a more wholesome feel. More importantly, we will work more on the back-end server side code. By sprint two, we hope to have a completed user profile that user's can edit, users can view other user's profiles, and if time permits, a messaging system for users to communicate. </p>

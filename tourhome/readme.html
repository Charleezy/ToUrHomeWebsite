<p class="p2">SPRINT ONE NOTES:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The website still falls a bit short on device friendliness, therefore, it is best if the website is viewed on a 1280 x 800 resolution screen. For this sprint, our group decided that because the nature of our website revolved around massive amounts of data, that we begin implementing more back-end code to the website. This would have laid a better foundation for the user interface. Hence, during sprint one we successfully implemented a workable database. With that database we were able to give it workable functionalities -- create an account, login to an account, delete an account, and change password. Because of the implementation of server-side related code, we fell short in the user interface of the code.</p>
<p class="p3">The website is fairly straight forward to navigate at the moment. You can create an account using the sign-in button on the first carousel and afterwards login using that information.</p>
<p class="p3">For sprint two, we have decided to further the user interface to give the website a more wholesome feel. More importantly, we will work more on the back-end server side code. By sprint two, we hope to have a completed user profile that user's can edit, users can view other user's profiles, and if time permits, a messaging system for users to communicate.</p>
<p class="p3">If you would like access to our server and database feel free to email me at stevenpakfung.lau@mail.utoronto.ca</p>

<p class="p5"><b>SPRINT TWO NOTES:</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b>OUR WEBSITE LINK IS : WWW.TOUR-HOME.ORG &lt;&lt;&lt; this is working website with it’s own database connected to myPHPadmin</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b>if you need to see our database message stevenpakfunglau@mail.utoronto.ca for passwords to server, and database.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Sprint two we worked on more of the back-end code specifically everything you view in the profile bar after you login. The functionalities work, but it still lacks a bit on the UI side of things, which we will finalize for sprint 3. We may also include more attributes in the database for sprint 3. Also minor, and major bugs were fixed during this sprint, and the UI for transitional pages have been added for a better look.</p>
<p class="p5">Steven - fixed bugs in the html, and php files. Working on the user interface and transitional pages. Adjusted database code around to suit the needs of other team mates.</p>
<p class="p5">Dan - worked on creating posts, and displaying posts along with the UI involved with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5">Charlie - worked on searching posts, and searching users.</p>
<p class="p5">Helen - worked on the picture uploading, and profile editing.</p>
<p class="p5">Users can now register and create an account, and afterwards willl be redirected to the login page where the sign in with their account information. Afterwards users, can go into their profile and make changes to their profile. The can also add posts, delete posts, and search posts regarding places to live in our countries. They can also search for users. Finally, the can delete their profile if wanted or even change their password and log out. A more concrete change will be made for sprint 3.</p>
